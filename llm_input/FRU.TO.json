            "article_text": "It looks like Freehold Royalties Ltd. ( ) is about to go ex-dividend in the next 4 days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Therefore, if you purchase Freehold Royalties' shares on or after the 29th of November, you won't be eligible to receive the dividend, when it is paid on the 16th of December.\n\nThe company's upcoming dividend is CA$0.09 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of CA$1.08 per share to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Freehold Royalties has a trailing yield of approximately 7.5% on its current stock price of CA$14.44. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Freehold Royalties's dividend is reliable and sustainable. As a result, readers should always check whether Freehold Royalties has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut.\n\nDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Freehold Royalties paid out 123% of profit in the past year, which we think is typically not sustainable unless there are mitigating characteristics such as unusually strong cash flow or a large cash balance. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Freehold Royalties paid out more free cash flow than it generated - 166%, to be precise - last year, which we think is concerningly high. We're curious about why the company paid out more cash than it generated last year, since this can be one of the early signs that a dividend may be unsustainable.\n\nCash is slightly more important than profit from a dividend perspective, but given Freehold Royalties's payments were not well covered by either earnings or cash flow, we are concerned about the sustainability of this dividend.\n\nClick\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nBusinesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. It's encouraging to see Freehold Royalties has grown its earnings rapidly, up 49% a year for the past five years. Earnings per share are increasing at a rapid rate, but the company is paying out more than we think is sustainable, based on current earnings. Generally, when a company is paying out more than it earned as dividends, it could signal either that the company is spending heavily to fund its growth, or that earnings growth is likely to slow due to lack of reinvestment.\n\nMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Freehold Royalties has seen its dividend decline 4.3% per annum on average over the past 10 years, which is not great to see. Freehold Royalties is a rare case where dividends have been decreasing at the same time as earnings per share have been improving. It's unusual to see, and could point to unstable conditions in the core business, or more rarely an intensified focus on reinvesting profits.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Freehold Royalties? While it's nice to see earnings per share growing, we're curious about how Freehold Royalties intends to continue growing, or maintain the dividend in a downturn given that it's paying out such a high percentage of its earnings and cashflow. With the way things are shaping up from a dividend perspective, we'd be inclined to steer clear of Freehold Royalties.\n\nHaving said that, if you're looking at this stock without much concern for the dividend, you should still be familiar of the risks involved with Freehold Royalties. To help with this, we've discovered that you should be aware of before investing in their shares.\n\nIf you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend\n\nNew: AI Stock Screener & Alerts Our new AI Stock Screener scans the market every day to uncover opportunities. \u2022 Dividend Powerhouses (3%+ Yield)\n\n\u2022 Undervalued Small Caps with Insider Buying\n\n\u2022 High growth Tech and AI Companies\n\n\n\nOr build your own from over 50 metrics.

            "article_text": "Open this photo in gallery: Precision Drilling Corp. trainees are directed while training to lay down drill pipe on a rig floor, at Precision Drilling in Nisku, Alta., in this file photo from Jan. 20, 2016. Precision Drilling Corp. was down 45 per cent on Monday.JASON FRANSON/The Canadian Press\n\nA tidal wave of selling hit Canada\u2019s energy sector on Monday \u2013 with some stocks losing more than half their value \u2013 as investors punished companies with higher costs and larger debt burdens that make them vulnerable to the crashing oil market.\n\nOvintiv Inc., which recently relocated to the United States from Calgary, was hit with a massive loss on the day, tumbling by 72 per cent as investors spurned its exposure to U.S. shale operations and the growing risk that its market capitalization may not meet minimum thresholds to join key stock indexes.\n\nNo energy company can thrive with oil prices crashing back to near the lowest levels of the last downturn, but some in the sector face more pressure than others, and investors zeroed in on debt and production costs as reasons to sell them off.\n\nAmong other big losers on the day were Cenovus Energy Inc., down 52 per cent, MEG Energy Corp., down 56 per cent, Precision Drilling Corp., down 45 per cent, and Athabasca Oil Corp., down 30 per cent.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a level of price where this doesn\u2019t work for anyone. We\u2019re seeing prices below the best in the sector\u2019s break-evens,\u201d said Chris Cox, analyst at Raymond James. \u201cIt\u2019s really, at this juncture, a game of survival until we see Saudi Arabia or Russia blink, and that\u2019s a pretty challenging prospect.\u201d\n\nThe massive falls were triggered by the 25-per-cent skid in benchmark crude prices. West Texas Intermediate fell US$10.15 to US$31.33 a barrel after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia failed to agree on output limits, and Saudi Arabia cut its official selling price in retaliation. Oil had already weakened because of concern about the economic impact of the coronavirus spread.\n\nInvestors lopped US$1.5-billion from the value of Ovintiv, the former Encana. The shares had already been under pressure after it consolidated them on a one-for-five basis in January. Chief executive officer Doug Suttles had said the changes were aimed at attracting investments by U.S. index funds. However, with a market capitalization of US$574-million, Ovintiv is well below the minimum for a key index \u2013 the S&P MidCap 400 \u2013 at US$2.4-billion.\n\nAs always, large debt burdens represent the biggest risk to corporate health as cash flow dwindles with oil prices. High operating costs and other spending commitments also take their toll, as the industry saw when oil tumbled in late 2014. Canada\u2019s energy sector never fully recovered from that, though numerous producers have slashed their operating costs and paid down debt to protect against further weakness.\n\nRaymond James downgraded most of the companies in the sector to \u201cmarket perform\u201d on Monday to account for the fall in crude prices, with the exceptions of Suncor Energy Inc., Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., Tourmaline Oil Corp., PrairieSky Royalty Ltd. and Freehold Royalties Ltd. They are seen as the most resilient in this environment. For example, Canadian Natural frequently adjusts its spending to deal with commodity prices and transport constraints, and is rewarded in the market for doing so.\n\nAmong the more vulnerable, Athabasca has debt maturities over the next couple of years and a comparatively high-cost asset base, Mr. Cox at Raymond James said. The company has hedged a large proportion of its heavy oil production at well-above current prices, but refinancing will still be a challenge, he said.\n\nCenovus is more exposed to heavy oil pricing than some of its integrated energy peers, such as Suncor, which has larger refining capacity for its production. In addition, as an oil sands producer with steam-driven operations, it is difficult for Cenovus to shut down production to save costs, given the potential damage to bitumen reservoirs.\n\nTD Securities on Monday pegged the break-even U.S. oil price for such projects in the industry at US$43 a barrel.\n\nOne saving grace for Canadian energy companies, especially oil sands players, is that they do not require the maintenance capital that is necessary to arrest declining production in U.S. shale, said Robert Fitzmartyn, analyst at Stifel FirstEnergy.\n\n\u201cThe costs have come in quite a bit. If you factor in the production-decline argument, sustaining capital spending for Canadian energy, especially some of the oil sands guys, is near zero,\u201d he said. \"But you\u2019re still at an absolute price level where the businesses are just very challenged, period.\u201d\n\nYour time is valuable.

            "article_text": "Are you looking for monthly income-paying investments outside of traditional fixed income like GICs or bonds?\n\nThere are certain stocks that pay more frequent dividends, which can be a great addition to an income-focused portfolio.\n\nOnly around 2% of dividend-paying, publicly-traded stocks pay their dividends on a monthly basis.\n\nWe will cover the best monthly dividend stocks in Canada below and discuss some of their features in more detail.\n\nShould you Invest in Monthly Dividend Stocks?\n\nMonthly dividend stocks can fit very well within a portfolio designed to provide a steady monthly income stream. They can help to reduce the interest rate risk that bonds will be vulnerable to.\n\nHere are some circumstances in which to consider adding monthly dividend stocks to your portfolio.\n\n1. Increasing Portfolio Diversification\n\nIf your portfolio does not currently contain stocks or other investments outside of bonds, adding monthly dividend stocks will likely boost its diversification. This is valuable because it can also help to reduce your portfolio\u2019s interest rate risk.\n\n2. Boosting Portfolio Yield\n\nSome monthly dividend stocks pay an incredibly high yield on an annualized basis. While some high-yield bonds may also pay a high-income stream, most investment-grade bonds tend to pay a modest yield.\n\nAdding high dividend-yielding stocks to your portfolio may increase its overall yield.\n\n3. Your Risk Tolerance is too High for Bonds\n\nBonds offer limited upside potential, especially in a flat or rising rate environment. For more aggressive investors who are also looking for a monthly income stream, monthly dividend stocks can be a great alternative or complement.\n\nInvesting in monthly dividend stocks will give you more upside potential, provided you invest in good-quality stocks.\n\nPros and Cons of Monthly Dividend Stocks\n\nStocks that pay income on a monthly basis have their advantages and disadvantages for investors.\n\nPros\n\nIncome on a monthly basis as opposed to quarterly, semi-annually, or annually\n\nDiversification for a traditional fixed-income portfolio designed for monthly income\n\nCan be used to offset monthly expenses\n\nCons\n\nAdditional costs involved with paying dividends to investors more often\n\nThe company is always required to have cash on hand (higher liquidity requirement)\n\nThe company may be limited in its ability to grow over time\n\nHow to Pick Monthly Dividend Stocks\n\nYou should look at certain features of a monthly dividend stock before adding it to your portfolio.\n\nMonthly dividend stocks should be assessed based on the following:\n\nTheir dividend yield on an annualized basis\n\nHow safe a company\u2019s dividend yield is, based on its payout ratio\n\nIf the stock fits your portfolio from a geographical allocation perspective\n\nIf the stock fits your portfolio from a sector perspective\n\nOther generic stock-picking criteria (business model, growth potential, etc.)\n\nAdding monthly dividend stocks to your portfolio should increase the positive elements of your portfolio (diversification, yield, etc.).\n\nWhat Canadian Companies Pay Monthly Dividends?\n\nThis is a full list of all Canadian companies that issue monthly dividends. This list does not include REITs (I have added those at the bottom of the article)\n\nThe Best Monthly Dividend Stocks in Canada\n\nWhitecap Resources (WCP)\n\nNorthland Power (NPI.TO)\n\nExchange Income (EIF.TO)\n\nFirst National Financial (FN.TO)\n\nPeyto Exploration & Development (PEY.TO)\n\nFreehold Royalties (FRU.TO)\n\nSienna Senior Living (SIA.TO)\n\nExtendicare (EXE.TO)\n\nAtrium Mortgage Investment (AI.TO)\n\n1. Whitecap Resources\n\nTicker: WCP\n\nWCP Forward Dividend Yield: 7.85%\n\n7.85% Dividend Payout Ratio: 36.32%\n\n36.32% Dividend Yield (12-Month Trailing): 6.88%\n\n6.88% Upcoming Dividend Date: Sep 16, 2024\n\nSep 16, 2024 Market Cap: $6.03 Billion\n\nWhitecap Resources is an upstream energy company engaged in the extraction of oil and, to a limited extent, natural gas. It operates in three provinces \u2013 Alberta, Saskatchewan, and British Columbia, and as per the company\u2019s claims, over 50% of its inventory is counted among the best assets in North America.\n\nThe company has several other financial and operational strengths as well. The operational strengths include its premium assets and their life (at least 25 years).\n\nIts carbon dioxide sequestering operation is massive, and the company stores about 2 million of the gas each year. That\u2019s comparable to companies dedicated to carbon sequestering.\n\nIt\u2019s more than just an ESG \u201chonorific.\u201d As a sustainable producer with solid numbers to back up its claim, Whitecap can attract both ESG investors and institutional investment more readily compared to its low ESG score peers.\n\nFinancially, it\u2019s a great pick for its low debt and its radical revenue growth between 2020 and 2022 \u2013 well over 4.5x. This indicates how quickly (if you are evaluating for the long-term) it can bounce back from adverse market events like COVID.\n\nIts dividends are also financially sustainable, with a payout ratio below 30% and only about 53% of its free fund flow going back to shareholders.\n\nIts forecasts are quite reasonable, and buying back shares is a financial priority for the company. The yield of over 5% and an attractive valuation (at the time of writing this) are strong points in the company\u2019s favour, but you should look into the company\u2019s dividend history as well.\n\nIt has a history of cutting dividends to keep them financially viable, which is essentially a healthy approach, but you won\u2019t like this trend reflected in your dividend income from this company.\n\nThat said, you should know that its future, at least the next few years, seems brighter than its past few years.\n\n2. Northland Power\n\nTicker: NPI.TO\n\nNPI.TO Forward Dividend Yield: 5.31%\n\n5.31% Dividend Payout Ratio: 76.92%\n\n76.92% Dividend Yield (12-Month Trailing): 5.43%\n\n5.43% Upcoming Dividend Date: Sep 16, 2024\n\nSep 16, 2024 Market Cap: $5.68 Billion\n\nNorthland Power is a major electricity producer in Canada with a \u201cclean\u201d and green portfolio of power-producing assets. Over 75% of its portfolio is made up of renewables, primarily wind, and the rest comes from natural gas.\n\nThe portfolio is geographically diversified as well \u2013 with 40% of its asset base in Europe and 25% in Asia.\n\nThe current net capacity is 3 GW (Gross), which might be considered relatively low for a company of its size, but its projections are quite ambitious \u2013 12 GW by 2030.\n\nAll these strengths literally come at a cost, and part of this price is a significant debt of $7.4 billion, which at the time of writing this, is larger than its current market capitalization.\n\nBut it\u2019s important to remember that heavy debt is common in the utility sector, considering the installation and maintenance costs associated with maintaining existing assets and acquiring/developing new ones.\n\nIt has shown steady financial growth between 2015 and 2022 \u2013 with sales growing from $728 million to $2.4 billion and net income from $27 million to $955 million.\n\nIts dividends have mostly remained financially stable, with a payout ratio below 75% (Except 2021). Thanks to a massive discount, the yield and value are both quite attractive at the time of writing this, and though the stock hasn\u2019t done so recently, it did grow its payouts twice in the last decade.\n\nAs a utility business, especially a financially healthy one that is generating a decent operating income, Northland Power seems like a solid dividend pick, but you should keep an eye on its debt. If the company starts mismanaging its debt and stretches itself too thin (financially), it may become a risky holding.\n\n3. Exchange Income\n\nTicker: EIF.TO\n\nEIF.TO Forward Dividend Yield: 5.79%\n\n5.79% Dividend Payout Ratio: 94.74%\n\n94.74% Dividend Yield (12-Month Trailing): 5.23%\n\n5.23% Upcoming Dividend Date: Sep 13, 2024\n\nSep 13, 2024 Market Cap: $2.37 Billion\n\nExchange Income is an acquisition-oriented company that has developed a diverse portfolio of aviation and aerospace businesses.\n\nThis includes an aeromedical service in Kuwait, a stainless fabrication company and a crew training company in the US, and a variety of local businesses. It also has a few regional airlines in its portfolio.\n\nIt\u2019s a debt-heavy business, but the bulk of its debt is long-term, which often spikes thanks to its acquisitions. Apart from that, the financials seem quite healthy. The revenue has doubled in the decade between 2013 and 2022, and net earnings have grown by a significant margin in the last three years alone.\n\nIt also has leadership consistency, with Mike Pyle serving as the CEO since 2006.\n\nIt also has a stellar dividend history, although its aristocratic status is currently disputed as it paused dividend growth for a year (similar to the banks); in the subsequent year, it grew its payouts twice.\n\nThe payouts are typically financially viable, and the yield typically remains above 5%. The valuation is modestly high at the time of writing this.\n\nYou should understand that despite the risk it carries as an aerospace-oriented company, which manifested as a 60% devaluation during COVID, it\u2019s a very resilient stock that made a swift recovery.\n\nIts long-term capital appreciation potential is also a factor worth considering, whether or not it\u2019s a primary concern for you. There is relatively little downside to this stock.\n\n4. First National Financial\n\nTicker: FN.TO\n\nFN.TO Forward Dividend Yield: 6.36%\n\n6.36% Dividend Payout Ratio: 58.01%\n\n58.01% Dividend Yield (12-Month Trailing): 6.48%\n\n6.48% Upcoming Dividend Date: Sep 16, 2024\n\nSep 16, 2024 Market Cap: $2.26 Billion\n\nFirst National Financial is a leader in a niche market \u2013 non-bank mortgage lenders. It\u2019s an incredibly difficult market to break into if you are vetting customers on the same credit standards as big banks (good credit score).\n\nBut First National still managed to acquire a decent piece of this market by offering flexible and fast mortgage solutions.\n\nIt also offers commercial mortgages and loans. In 35 years, the company has furnished over 300,000 residential mortgages and over 5,700 commercial loans.\n\nIts mortgage portfolio is substantial compared to its market capitalization, and over two-thirds of it consists of insured mortgages, so the level of financial uncertainty is relatively low.\n\nA major strength of the company is its 38% insider ownership, which is beyond impressive. However, its long-term financial growth (in the last decade) is minimal, even though the stock has risen by a decent margin over the same period.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t impacted the financial sustainability of its dividends, and its dividend history is not just financially healthy, but it\u2019s also augmented with consistent dividend growth for eleven years (in 2023).\n\nEven though First National Financial is a stellar dividend aristocrat, you should take into account its exposure to the housing market.\n\nIf the housing bubble bursts in Canada, it may put a financial strain on this company, similar to what US banks experienced in the great recession (significantly throttled, thanks to Canada\u2019s strong financial oversight). It may be exacerbated by the fact that it\u2019s a small player in the mortgage market.\n\n5. Peyto Exploration & Development\n\nTicker: PEY.TO\n\nPEY.TO Forward Dividend Yield: 10.80%\n\n10.80% Dividend Payout Ratio: 63.33%\n\n63.33% Dividend Yield (12-Month Trailing): 9.12%\n\n9.12% Upcoming Dividend Date: Sep 13, 2024\n\nSep 13, 2024 Market Cap: $2.85 Billion\n\nPeyto is an upstream company, and even though they tend to be more vulnerable to energy price fluctuations compared to midstream players, Peyto offers certain advantages. The primary advantage is its position among the most significant natural gas producers in the country.\n\nIts share in the overall mix was only 3% in 2022, but that\u2019s quite significant, considering it\u2019s a mid-cap (on the lower end), while all producers with a bigger share are large-cap energy companies.\n\nIts other strength is its reserves. There are enough reserves to keep producing at the current level for nine years, and the reserves for the next 24 years have been developed but are not currently producing. So the company may be good for the next two decades.\n\nIt\u2019s also a low-cost producer that\u2019s currently producing at $1.62/mcfe, which is significantly lower than the 2022 breakeven of US $2.31/mcfe. The natural gas focus itself is a major strength as it\u2019s the cleanest fossil fuel that may outlast oil in the market.\n\nAll of these are strong points for a dividend payer. Its financials are healthy, not strong, but the valuation is quite attractive. But the dividend-related financials, i.e., the payout ratio, has been quite stable since 2018, though it\u2019s partly because of the dividend cuts it introduced.\n\nThe company is also heavily discounted from its 2016 peak and quite undervalued at the time of writing.\n\nThe current yield is exceptional \u2013 over 10%, but you should know that the company slashed its dividends (and occasionally suspended them) between 2018 and 2022, but to its credit, it has restored the payouts to its former level, hence the high yield.\n\nIt\u2019s a very strong monthly dividend payer pick right now, but you should keep its dividend history in mind to make an informed decision.\n\n6. Freehold Royalties\n\nTicker: FRU.TO\n\nFRU.TO Forward Dividend Yield: 7.87%\n\n7.87% Dividend Payout Ratio: 117.39%\n\n117.39% Dividend Yield (12-Month Trailing): 8.16%\n\n8.16% Upcoming Dividend Date: Sep 16, 2024\n\nSep 16, 2024 Market Cap: $2.01 Billion\n\nFreehold Royalties offer a unique way to invest in the energy sector \u2013 through land royalties. The company owns about 6.4 million cross acres in Canada and 0.9 million gross acres (drilling) in the US.\n\nAbout 80% of the company\u2019s revenues come from oil and Natural Gas Liquids extracted from its lands, and the rest from natural gas.\n\nDespite a significantly smaller land position, the US holdings contribute 40% of the company\u2019s revenue, and the company has major prospects in the country \u2013 over 7,450 locations that can be developed/drilled.\n\nThe financials of the company are growing at a healthy pace \u2013 over 2.8 times in the five years between 2018 and 2022. The netback from production over this period almost doubled.\n\nIts healthy financials support healthy dividends, but its payout history has been quite erratic. In one year (2020), the company slashed its payouts by 71%, and in the next year, it grew its dividends by 300%.\n\nAn easy way to understand it is that the company\u2019s dividends reflect its financial position and, to an extent, the financial condition of the energy sector in Canada.\n\nYou should understand the risk and benefit this approach to dividends carry. The lack of consistency will benefit you when the energy sector is thriving since the company may pay outsized dividends compared to the rest of the sector.\n\nBut if the sector is in trouble (like it was during COVID), you may experience a massive dividend cut. It may hurt in the short term but will even out in the long term.\n\n7. Sienna Senior Living\n\nTicker: SIA.TO\n\nSIA.TO Forward Dividend Yield: 8.56%\n\n8.56% Dividend Payout Ratio: 628.19%\n\n628.19% Dividend Yield (12-Month Trailing): 5.56%\n\n5.56% Upcoming Dividend Date: Sep 13, 2024\n\nSep 13, 2024 Market Cap: $1.39 Billion\n\nSienna Senior Living is a Markham-based senior care company that offers different types of senior living options, including long-term care facilities (43 in two provinces) and retirement communities/residences.\n\nSeniors aged 85, i.e., the bulk of the target market for long-term care facilities, is a steadily increasing population segment in Canada.\n\nThe number was 861,000 in 2021 and is expected to triple by 2046. Annualized, that\u2019s an addition of about 68,880 new seniors aged 85 or more, which indicates adequate target market growth.\n\nThe company boasts a healthy occupancy rate, and even though it fluctuates, it typically remains close to or above 90% for both retirement communities and long-term care services.\n\nBut it\u2019s also an expensive business \u2013 with thousands of staff members and dozens of facilities to maintain. However, a consistent cash flow helps keep the business afloat.\n\nThe financial health of its dividends is not very impressive, but its dividend history is. It has been paying dividends quite consistently since 2010 and has grown its payouts at least twice during that period.\n\nYou might be interested in Sienna Senior Living right now, thanks to its impressive yield (close to 8% at the time of writing this). The financials might seem off-putting to you, but the dividend history endorses the company\u2019s ability to meet its dividend obligation to the investors.\n\nHowever, you should consider the reputational risks a company like Sienna carries. One major scandal or a reputation for mistreatment may significantly impact its business and, consequently, its dividends.\n\n8. Extendicare\n\nTicker: EXE.TO\n\nEXE.TO Forward Dividend Yield: 6.81%\n\n6.81% Dividend Payout Ratio: 228.57%\n\n228.57% Dividend Yield (12-Month Trailing): 5.1%\n\n5.1% Upcoming Dividend Date: Sep 16, 2024\n\nSep 16, 2024 Market Cap: $785.42 Million\n\nExtendicare offers its investors a different slice of senior care. Even though the bulk of its revenue comes from the long-term care facilities under the company\u2019s purview, a significant segment (over 44% in 2023) comes from its homecare services and managed services.\n\nThis service mix makes it a slightly less expensive senior care business with more scalability potential.\n\nIt has substantial debt, and its financials aren\u2019t weak per se, but they are not as healthy as they used to be. The Funds from Operations fell from $66 million to $22 million between 2013 and 2022. However, the net income has been in the green for the last three years.\n\nIts major strengths as a monthly dividend stock in Canada are a good dividend yield and stable dividend history. It has maintained its payouts at the same level for a decade, while its payout ratio has almost never been at a healthy level.\n\nYou should evaluate its financial weaknesses against its operational strengths. If the company maintains and grows its current operational reach, especially in the homecare business, the financials will eventually catch up.\n\nMeanwhile, you will have to rely on its commitment to maintaining its dividends and its payout history for your dividend sustainability.\n\n9. Atrium Mortgage Investment\n\nTicker: AI.TO\n\nAI.TO Forward Dividend Yield: 8.70%\n\n8.70% Dividend Payout Ratio: 76.27%\n\n76.27% Dividend Yield (12-Month Trailing): 7.59%\n\n7.59% Upcoming Dividend Date: Sep 12, 2024\n\nSep 12, 2024 Market Cap: $525.36 Million\n\nAtrium Mortgage offers a range of financial solutions to commercial real estate owners/investors and conventional residential mortgages to market segments that are not being served by the banks. This includes self-employed individuals and newcomers to the country that may not have an adequate credit history.\n\nFrom a portfolio perspective, the two major strengths of the company are its portfolio mix, which is over 95% first mortgages, and over 96% of the loans have a Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio of less than 75% (Q1 2023).\n\nA low LTV portfolio indicates that most of the company\u2019s customers have enough \u201cskin in the game\u201d that their chances of defaulting on their mortgages are low.\n\nAnother strength of the company is its minimal operational expenses, which allows it to divert a hefty portion of its income to shareholders without jeopardizing the financial viability of its operations.\n\nThe payout ratio has been quite close to crossing the 100% mark in the past decade, but it has always remained on the right side of the border.\n\nOne thing that may discourage you from Atrium Mortgage as a dividend investment is its low market value, but despite being a small, small-cap stock, Atrium has exhibited adequate financial strength to easily sustain its dividends.\n\nIt\u2019s healthy yield and attractive valuation are current incentives to consider this stock, and its financial history endorses its position as a long-term holding.\n\nCanada\u2019s Monthly Dividend Paying REITs\n\nREITs in Canada work a bit differently than regular stock, but they pay monthly dividends.

By spreading investments across various sectors and companies, risks related to a specific area\u2019s downturn are minimized. This approach also ensures a more balanced flow of dividend income, as different sectors may perform differently based on market conditions.\n\nDiversifying also provides investors with a chance to tap into the growth of multiple industries, from traditional sectors like banking to emerging ones like technology. A well-diversified portfolio remains resilient, navigating market changes with fewer adverse impacts.\n\nWhat are some low-cost Canadian monthly dividend Stocks?\n\nExtendicare and Atrium Mortgage are among the appealing low-cost Canadian monthly dividend stocks. Extendicare is notable for its diversified offerings in senior care and has a history of consistent dividends. In contrast, Atrium Mortgage serves niche segments, especially those not traditionally catered to by mainstream banks.\n\nConclusion\n\nCanada has a lot of excellent monthly dividend stocks to choose from.\n\nWhile monthly dividend stocks can be constrained in how they manage their business over long periods of time, they can be a great addition to portfolios geared toward monthly income.\n\nAside from monthly dividend stocks, you can also invest in some of the best monthly dividend ETFs that can help potentially further improve your portfolio\u2019s diversification."
